Protocol
--------

The npw protocol is very simple and resembles standard shell command
invocation. After connecting via TCP to the server (which listens on
port 7750 by default), te client sends a single line of text
representing a command followed by zero or more arguments separated by
spaces. The final newline character ('\n') prompts the server to
generate a single-line response, after which the server closes the
connection.

The npw server should accept the following requests:

- `send-email email-address [identifier]`

  Sends an email containing the login token, using the template that
  was specified when the server was started. On success, the server
  responds with `email sent`. On error, the server responds with
  `error: ` followed by a description of why the email could not be
  sent.

  By default, the npw server will not sent more than 3 emails per 24
  hours to the same email address. Furthermore, the optional argument
  `identifier` can be used to limit login requests per client. By
  default, the npw server will not sent more then 3 emails per 24
  hours for the same identifier. It is suggested that you use your
  client's IP address as the identifier.

- `validate-token token`

  Looks up the token in the database of sent emails. If found, the
  server returns the associated email address and deletes it from the
  database.  This means you can exchange a valid token for an email
  address only once!  On error, the server responds with the string
  `error: ` followed by the error description.
